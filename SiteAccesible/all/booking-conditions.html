                    <h3>International Passengers, Notice of Baggage Liability Limitations</h3>
                    <p>
                        Liability for loss, delay, or damage to baggage is limited unless a higher value is declared in advance and additional charges are paid. For most international travel (including domestic portions of international journeys) the liability limit is approximately US$ 9.07 per pound (US$ 20.00 per kilo) for checked baggage and US$ 400.00 per passenger for unchecked baggage. For travel wholly between US points, Federal rules require any limit on an airline baggage liability to be at least US$ 1,250.00 per passenger. Excess valuation may not be declared on certain types of articles. Some carriers assume no liability for fragile, valuable or perishable articles. Further information may be obtained from the carrier.
                    </p>
