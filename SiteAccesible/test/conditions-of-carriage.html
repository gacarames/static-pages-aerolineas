	<h2>
		INFORMATION TO INTERNATIONAL PASSENGERS DEPARTING FROM AN AIRPORT LOCATED IN THE TERRITORY OF A MEMBER STATE OF THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY.</h2>
	<p>
		If a flight of this company has its origin in some airport situated within a Member State of the European Union, the contents of the legal regulation established by the European Union (by means of directives and/or regulations), can be excluded to part of the present conditions of the transport.</p>
	<p>
		Based on the above and for the purposes of the legislation of the European Union, especially the provisions in Regulation (EC) 2027 / 1997, amended by the Regulation (EC) 889/2002, is also reported:</p>
	<p>
		Airline responsibility for passengers and their baggage This information summarizes the liability rules applied by Community air carriers, in accordance with Community legislation and the Montreal Convention</p>
	<p>
		Compensation in the event of death or injury there are no financial limits to the liability for passenger injury or death. For damages up to 100 000 DGE (approximate amount in local currency), the airline may not contest claims for compensation. Above that amount, the airline can only challenge a claim by proving that it was not negligent or due to lack of another type.</p>
	<p>
		Advances in the event of death or injury of a passenger, the airline must make, within a period of fifteen days from day of identification of the person entitled to compensation, an advance payment, to cover immediate economic needs. In the event of death, this advance payment shall not be less than 16 000 DEG (approximate amount in local currency).</p>
	<p>
		Passenger delay, in case of delay of the passenger, the carrier is liable for damage unless it took all reasonable measures to avoid the damage or it was impossible to take such measures. The liability for passenger delay is limited to 4 150 SDRS (approximate amount in local currency).</p>
	<p>
