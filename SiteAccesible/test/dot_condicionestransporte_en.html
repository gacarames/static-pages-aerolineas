They shall receive a form where they shall declare the missing or damaged content and the estimated value. For the legal purposes, the reception of the form completed and signed by passengers on the part of the Carrier shall constitute the formal complaint which shall create a claim file that must be closed within 30 days. Said complaint is a requirement for the filing of any possible legal action.</li>
                <li> If the form had not been completed, the Carrier shall deal with claims for lost, damaged, delayed or pilferaged baggage upon delivery within 3 days for domestic flights in case of damage or pilferage, and 10 days as of the estimated delivery date for unaccompanied baggage in case of loss, damage or delay.</li>
