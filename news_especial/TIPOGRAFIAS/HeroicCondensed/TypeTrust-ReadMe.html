<p>For step-by-step instructions on installing fonts on your computer, go to: <a href="http://www.typetrust.com/info/installation.php">http://www.typetrust.com/info/installation.php</a></p>
<p>Some Important Considerations When Handling Your Fonts:
<ul>
	<li>Never rename any font files.</li>
	<li>Do not install more than one format of any given font: Opentype, TrueType or PostScript Type 1.</li>
	<li>Macintosh operating systems prior to Mac OS X require Adobe Type Manager [ATM] to make use of Opentype and PostScript Type 1 fonts.</li>
	<li>Not all Opentype fonts are programmed with advanced typesetting features. Likewise, not every design application supports advanced Opentype features.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>For OS and application specific installation instructions, please refer to the documentation supplied with the application.</p>
